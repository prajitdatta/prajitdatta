AI Systems Architect | Applied Artificial Intelligence | International Public Speaker

I work on making artificial intelligence usable in the real world.  
My focus is not building models in isolation, but designing systems where AI becomes a dependable operational capability inside organisations.

I help teams move from experimentation to adoption by combining engineering discipline, architecture thinking and business context.

## What I Do

I design and guide implementation of AI driven systems that operate in production environments.

Areas I typically work on:

• Enterprise AI architecture and platform design  
• AI copilots and workflow automation  
• Human + AI decision support systems  
• Autonomous monitoring and operational intelligence  
• Responsible AI governance and risk controls  

The goal is always the same:  
AI should reduce uncertainty, not introduce it.

## Current Interests

I am particularly interested in how organisations evolve when AI becomes a normal co worker rather than a tool.

Topics I explore and write about:

- AI native organisations
- Human machine collaboration
- Reliable automation at scale
- Trust and verification in AI outputs
- Operationalising large language models
- Cognitive load reduction using AI systems

---

## Background

I work with engineering and consulting environments where AI must integrate with real operational processes, not demos.

My experience includes:
- Enterprise scale data and AI platforms
- Cross functional adoption of AI tools
- Advisory on practical AI transformation
- Speaking and workshops on applied AI

## Writing

I publish long form thoughts and future scenarios:
