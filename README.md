## Hey, I'm Prajit 👋

**AI Research Scientist & Consultant** at [AFRY](https://afry.com) · **US Patent Holder** · **International Speaker**

I architect the transition from AI experimentation to production-scale impact — designing intelligent systems where AI becomes dependable operational infrastructure, not experimental software.

Based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Speaking across 20+ countries. Building in the open.

### 🔬 What I Do

At **AFRY** — one of Europe's largest engineering and consulting firms — I lead the **AI Global Competence Group** and work across industrial and enterprise environments, bridging advanced AI capabilities with real operational deployment.

Previously, I built financial data products and distributed ML systems at **Bank of America's Chief Data Scientist Organization (GTO)**, where I co-invented a **US Patent** for a hierarchical machine learning framework for adaptive enterprise threat detection.

**Core areas:** Intelligent Systems Architecture · AI Governance & Safety · Production ML · AI Product Strategy · Strategic Advisory

### 🛠️ Open Source — Giving Back

I believe the best way to advance AI is to build in the open. These tools are born from real production experience, shared freely.

| Repository | What it does |
|:---|:---|
| **[LLM-Semantic-Cache](https://github.com/prajitdatta/LLM-Semantic-Cache)** | Stop paying for the same LLM response twice. Cache by meaning, not exact text. |
| **[AI-Agent-Autopsy](https://github.com/prajitdatta/AI-Agent-Autopsy)** | Cut open broken LLM agents. Find what killed them. Fix it before you ship. |
| **[RAG-Autopsy](https://github.com/prajitdatta/RAG-Autopsy)** | Cut open broken RAG pipelines. Find what killed them. Fix it before you ship. |

### ✍️ Writing & Research

I write about production AI, future cities, governance, and what happens when intelligence stops living only inside humans.
